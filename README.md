- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davetapson
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a senior developer / solutions architect working solidly in the MS world - C#, .NET, SQL Server etc with a lot of Oracle experience and reasonable experience with MySQL, SQLite etc.  Some experience with javascript frameworks, but that's not my happy playground.
     Industries worked in mainly finance/insurance based with the odd foray into business processes and engineering environments.
- ðŸŒ± My personal projects relate to automated trading - currently automating TradeStation, previously AmiBroker
